Although uncle Huang loses the distich competition, he is still seeking for a male tutor. He would choose one of those who left comments below his post as his tutor ( and one cannot refuse! ). Because too many people left comments below ( just like Shiao said, he's truly a topic master ), he would pick two numbers "x" and "y", and choose the (xy)-th person that left a comment as his tutor.

Because xy might be too big, so the answer would mod(取模) a number "m", which is the total number of comments of his post.

Uncle Huang is too busy seeking for his true love tutor, he asks you for help, could you help him find out his true love tutor?

You are given three numbers "x", "y", and "m", you have to calculate the answer of ((xy)%m) .
**Hint: Use "Fast Power" method to solve this problem!**
